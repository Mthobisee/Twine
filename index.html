            <div>This is Bob.</div>
            <div><img src="images/Bob_minions_exciting.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div>Bob sees a car advertised for R3,000 a month. Should he go and look at it or should he work out what he can afford first? &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Look at the car! He can work out the details later.]]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Work out his affordability]].&lt;/li&gt;</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Work out his affordability" tags="" position="581.5,376">
            <div>Correct - you should always work out what you can afford before you go looking or you might fall in love with something out of your reach.</div>
            <div><img src="images/5435af9c7edba4dc31d363520cafaf6c.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div>Bob earns R15,000 a month after tax and his other expenses are R10,000. How much should he spend each month on a car? &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[R5,000]]&lt;li&gt;[[R3,000]]&lt;li&gt;[[R2,000]]&lt;/ul&gt;</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Look at the car! He can work out the details later." tags="" position="321.5,376">
            <div>Oh dear, Bob only earns R10,000 a month. He&#x27;s going to be very disappointed when he does the sums later.</div>
            <div><img src="images/50447386.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div>It would be much wiser to [[Work out his affordability]] first.</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="4" name="R5,000" tags="" position="431.5,526">
            <div>Ooops, that&#x27;s far too much! Apart from his expenses he also needs money for other things.</div>
            <div><img src="images/Sad_minion.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div>You shouldn&#x27;t spend more than &lt;strong&gt;20% of your take-home salary&lt;/strong&gt; - that&#x27;s R3,000 for Bob - on your car, and that includes its fuel, insurance etc. as well as your car instalments. So Bob should be paying only
                about R2,000 on car payments. Now that he knows what he can afford, Bob can [[start looking]] for a car.</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="5" name="R3,000" tags="" position="581.5,526">
            <div>That&#x27;s almost correct. You shouldn&#x27;t spend more than 20% of your take-home salary on a car - that&#x27;s R3,000 for Bob.</div>
            <div><img src="images/Bob_Waaaa.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div>But that 20% needs to include your other car costs as well! So when Bob subtracts things like fuel, insurance and maintenance, he ends up with only about R2,000 left for his car payment. Now that he knows what he can afford, Bob can [[start
                looking]] for a car.</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="6" name="R2,000" tags="" position="731.5,526">
            <div>Well done, Bob!</div>

            <div>You shouldn&#x27;t spend more than 20% of your take-home salary on a car - that&#x27;s R3,000 for Bob. But that 20% needs to include your other car costs as well! So when Bob minuses things like fuel, insurance and maintenance, he ends up
                with only about R2,000 left for his car payment. Now that he knows what he can afford, Bob can [[start looking]] for a car.</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="7" name="start looking" tags="" position="581.5,676">
            <div>Bob sees a new Hot Hatch advertised for R2,000 a month.</div>
            <div><img src="images/9543030df322a83818fde663b80bf851--minions--minions-love.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div>He doesn&#x27;t even need a deposit, just a 35% balloon payment. Should he go for it? &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[[Yes, it looks like a great deal]]&lt;li&gt;[[No, that balloon payment is too high]]&lt;/ul&gt;</div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Yes, it looks like a great deal" tags="" position="506.5,826">
            <div>It LOOKS like a great deal now, but at the end of his contract Bob will suddenly need to pay the balloon payment - in cash!</div>
            <div><img src="images/tenor.gif" width="200px"></div>
        </tw-passagedata>
        <tw-passagedata pid="9" name="No, that balloon payment is too high" tags="" position="656.5,826">
            <div>You&#x27;re right! </div>
            <div><img src="images/83f7cc561fe4612619eb2d809e528905.jpg" width="200px"></div>
            <div> If Bob takes a 35% balloon payment, then he&#x27;ll need to pay a huge amount of cash at the end of his contract - it could be something like R40,000!</div>
